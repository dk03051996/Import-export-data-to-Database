Erase all the data of a DynamoDB table


Usage:
  dynamocli erase TABLE

Options:
  [--with-drift], [--no-with-drift]  # drop the table and
  recreate it directly instead of use deployments

Description:
  `dynamocli erase` will erase all the data of the specified table.

  It will drop the table and recreate it.

  If the table is in a stack it will try to deploy
  the stack without the table and then redeploy the
  stack with the original template. You can change
  this behavior passing the option --with-drift.
